# gallery-dl GUI
A user-friendly, cross-platform desktop application for downloading image links.
Built with Svelte and Tauri

## Roadmap
Majority of the backend code is done, I need suggestions on how I can make the UI look better (if at all)
- TODO: Queue all the downloads and make it persistent âœ…
- TODO: Settings panel where I can set Cookies, User Agent, and a dedicated page for oauth which Pixiv uses
- TODO: Separate page for managing all the Cookies for different sites

## Requirements
- 64 bit system

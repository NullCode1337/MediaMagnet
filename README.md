# MediaMagnet
A user-friendly, cross-platform desktop application for downloading any and all forms of media (image, video, torrent)


Built with Svelte and Tauri

## Roadmap
I need suggestions on how I can make the UI look better (if at all)
- TODO: Settings panel where I can set User Agent and other options ✅
- TODO: Separate page for managing all the Cookies for different sites, and oauth ❌
- TODO: Integrate yt-dlp and aria2 into the code as well ❌

## Requirements
- Windows or Linux (.deb, .rpm, AppImage provided) (AUR soon)
- 64 bit system

# gallery-dl GUI
A user-friendly, cross-platform desktop application for downloading image links.
Built with Svelte and Tauri

## Roadmap
It is still only a functional prototype, currently only Pixiv can be downloaded without concurrency, and no configuration options are present

- I have plans to keep this "Simple" mode, and add another "Advanced" mode which will contain a queue system which users will be able to choose between
- Also have to create a Settings panel where I can set Cookies, User Agent, and have a panel for oauth which stuff like pixiv uses
- More stuff to the README after I finish the fundamentals

## Requirements
- `gallery-dl` present in PATH, and pixiv oauth token pre-configured (plan to automate this)
